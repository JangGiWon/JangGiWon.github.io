## What is Notebook?

[**Notebook**](https://github.com/Grow-with-Open-Source/Notebook "Goto project Notebook") is an open-source project built on GitHub's [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "visit offical website") framework, designed to create a welcoming and collaborative platform for developers of all levels. We've used the charming [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy.git "visit official chirpy theme") theme to craft a blog-like website that's easy to navigate and explore.
